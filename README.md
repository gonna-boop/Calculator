# Calculator

I made it! By now ,I should have a really firm grasp on the fundamentals of JavaScript. Of course(!) thereâ€™s plenty more to learn, but I should be able to create quite a bit at this point. My final project of the foundations course is going to combine everything I've learned so far: I'll be  making an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

As usual with these things, there are elements of this project that will not be trivially easy for me, but since I've been following the course so far, I definitely have everything I need to complete this challenge.
